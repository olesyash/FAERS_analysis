#Final Project for Graphs Machine Learning Course
The idea is to take the data from FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)  https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html 
And to build a graph for drags and their reactions, then analyze the data using learned techniques, and machine learning.
